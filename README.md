# vh_trainingground/likely garbage/dumped idea   <br> ┐(︶▽︶)┌
It just my pure learning code repo and I want it to save somewhere,
used to throw away code that I write but sometime I forgot syntax so I need to get something that call my knowledge back again <br>

Currently learning/working on Ext, API, Service, Mini-Project saved in `Go/fundamental` and `Experimental`
